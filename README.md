This is a JavaScript built web scraper aimed at gathering player statistics from
the United States Chess Federation and displaying it in a more modern appearance.

To use, you can enter your player ID number and hit search where you will then see
certain statistics in this order:

1. Name
2. ID Number
3. Rating (Classical)
4. Number of Games Played
5. Number of Wins
6. Number of Draws
7. Number of Losses
8. Win Percentage
9. Draw Percentage
10. Loss Percentage

If you don't have a specific ID number or are just testing the website,
there is a link to a pdf with sample ID numbers you can try.
